# UMAP_PBM_cells

Introduction:
The paper that I selected to replicate images is titled: “A generalization of t-SNE and UMAP to single-cell multimodal omics”. Emerging single-cell technologies profile multiple types of molecules within individual cells. A fundamental step in the analysis of the produced high dimensional data is their visualization using dimensionality reduction techniques such as tSNE and UMAP. The motivation behind this paper is to introduce j-SNE and j-UMAP as their natural generalizations to the joint visualization of multimodal omics data. However, in our figures we will just use the UMAP technique to model our visualizations.
